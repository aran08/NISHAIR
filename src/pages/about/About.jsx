                  It wasn't easy starting something on my own. Especially in a
                  category that waseither seen as a mere fashion accessory or
                  spoken about in hush voices to avoidgarnering attention. I
                  remember struggling to simply build awareness about
                  how‘normal’ it could be to use hair extensions. Most saw them
                  as a taboo topic, anequivalent to wigs or simply shrugged off
                  the idea in disgust. But I knew fromthe time I wore my first
                  set of extensions that I loved them and could clearlysee in
                  them the potential to help thousands. To me, hair extensions
                  were a wayof spreading joy, building confidence and
                  celebrating freedom in one of themost basic ways possible. I
                  wear mine with a lot of pride and want to ensurethat all those
                  who wear them do the same.
